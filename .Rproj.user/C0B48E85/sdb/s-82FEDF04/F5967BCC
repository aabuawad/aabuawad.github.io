Throughout my undergraduate studies, I volunteered as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT-B) and CPR instructor, while also conducting research in my spare time. \nMy research in the biodistribution of nanoparticles in rat models sparked an interest in public health. Continuing my studies, I earned a Masterâ€™s in Public Health (MPH) with a concentration in Environmental Health from the [University at Albany School of Public Health](http://www.albany.edu/sph/) in 2017. During my MPH program, I studied the nutrient transition in Peru due to exposure to a Western diet as well as nutrient and contaminant levels of farmed and wild salmon. \n\nAt [Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/), I hope to expand my knowledge of environmental exposures and related health outcomes in historically underrepresented groups.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Resume\n\nMy full resume is available [here](Downloads/AKA_Resume.pdf).\n\n<br>\n\n#### Contact Information\n\nAhlam Abuawad\n[Department of Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/environmental-health-sciences-ehs)  \n[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/)  \n722 West 168th Street  \nNew York, New York 10032  \n\nEmail: [aka2170@cumc.columbia.edu](mailto:aka2170@cumc.columbia.edu)  \n\n",
