Ahlam received a BS in Biology and a BA in Chemistry from the [University at Albany, State University of New York](http://www.albany.edu/) in 2015. Throughout her undergraduate studies, Ahlam volunteered as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT-B) and CPR instructor, while also conducting research in her spare time.

<br>

Ahlam's research in the biodistribution of nanoparticles in rat models sparked an interest in public health. Continuing her studies, Ahlam earned a Masterâ€™s in Public Health (MPH) with a concentration in Environmental Health from the [University at Albany School of Public Health](http://www.albany.edu/sph/) in 2017. During her MPH program, Ahlam studied the nutrient transition in Peru due to exposure to a Western diet as well as nutrient and contaminant levels of farmed and wild salmon. 

<br>

At [Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/), Ahlam has expanded her knowledge of environmental exposures and related health outcomes in historically underrepresented groups.
